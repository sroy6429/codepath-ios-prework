# Pre-work - *Tips for All*

**Tips for All** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Sukriti Roy**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Included a section that allows user to enter the number of people in the party and divides the total including tip to show cost per person

## Notes

- I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to update the segment control with user entered tip values for a setting screen, but I kept running into errors with logic and implementing the code itself so I could not figure out how to do it properly. 
- The main issues outside of that lied in establishing connections correctly. Once I became more familiar with the view controller and the other settings, a lot of the work ran more smoothly.
